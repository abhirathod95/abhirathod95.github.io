title: Week 3!
---

## What did you do this past week? 
I spent most of my time last week working on the project. It started out pretty easy, but then got sort of confusing in the middle. I think the hardest part of the project was probably figuring out what exactly sphere tests against. I know I spent a good amount of time failing sphere because I thought that if j was smaller than i, it was an invalid case. Turned out, that was completely valid and I had to reverse them. I got the hang of the project after a while though and managed to pass all the test cases and turn it in on time.

## What's in your way? 
Probably time. Juggling school and work is suprisingly harder than I thought it would be. Combined with social expectations of senior year and recruitment season, this has got to be the busiest semester I have had in my college life.

## What will you do next week? 
I am going to be spending most of my time earlier in the week on projects from my other 2 CS classes. I plan on starting on the second project for this class in the second half of the week so that I can finish it not as close to the deadline as I did the first project.

## Describe your experience in the class so far.
Not much of my experience for the class has changed from the previous few classes.

## Tip-of the week:
Don't make a habit of sleeping early in the morning. It comes back to bite you really hard later.
