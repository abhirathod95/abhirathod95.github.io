title: Week 13!
---

## What did you do this past week? 
I spent most of my week applying to different places and preparing for recruiting this week. I also spent some time looking at the project, since the final version of the project was due this past week. I ended up spending most of my time finishing up projects due for other classes, since they were due this week too.

## What's in your way? 
Being efficient with time and prioritizing. I am trying to split my time up between work, school and friends and it can get hard during your senior year.

## What will you do next week? 
This week I plan on working on the 3 projects I have due next week thursday. In terms of this class, I plan on spending the week studying for the upcoming test, so hopefully that'll be enough to get it all done. The rest of the time I'll be spending time with my family and friends for Thanksgiving. 

## Describe your experience in the class so far.
With the class nearing it's end, I can say that this class has given me a really good foundation in software engineering skills that I am going to continue to develop throughout my whole career. I really enjoyed taking this class and found the assignments to be really fun. The class got challenging and tough at times (those quizes can really get to your grade), but I think in the end it was all worth it.

## Tip-of the week:
"The world is full of good people. If you can't find one, be one." Mother Teresa
