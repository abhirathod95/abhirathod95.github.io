title: Week 8!

## What did you do this past week? 
This past week I met up with my group and started on the IDB1 project. We were a bit behind at the start since we had a hard time picking a good topic that had a good api, but we pretty much caught up and on schedule now. We also got our test grades back for the class, and I did pretty well. I was hoping for something a bit higher, but at this point I am completely okay with what I got. 

## What's in your way? 
Time is usually in the way of getting things done. With a lot of my stuff due in the same week and usually only on Tuesdays and Thursdays (I only have classes 2 days a week but they add up to 12 hours) combined with part time work usually leaves me with very little time to do anything else in the week and a lot of catching up to do over the weekend.

## What will you do next week? 
Next week I'll be spending some more time with my group to finish up the first part of the project. Hopefully we will finish it on time!

## Describe your experience in the class so far.
After taking the first test, I am getting a clearer idea about what this class is about and the way it is going to go the rest of the semester. I am starting to get the hang of the quizes in the class and now I have a better idea of what we will be tested on the next test.
